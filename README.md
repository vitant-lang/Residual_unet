# Residual_unet
network with attention mechanisms and residual connections
model = ImprovedAutoencoderWithUNet(
    in_channels=16,  # Supports multi-modal input
    out_channels=4    # For segmentation/generation
)
​Core Components:
 Spatial Attention Module (Sequential[atta...])
 Residual Blocks (Visible as 62°.128 recurrent paths)
Ideal For
✔ Medical Image Segmentation
✔ Multi-channel Image Generation
✔ Super-Resolution Tasks
 Architectural Advantages
​Attention-Guided (Sequential[atta...]) focuses on critical regions
​Vanishing Gradient Solution: Residual connections (e.g., 62°.128.128 loops)
