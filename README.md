# Residual_unet
network with attention mechanisms and residual connections

model = ImprovedAutoencoderWithUNet
(
    
    in_channels=16,  # Supports multi-modal input
    
    out_channels=4    # For segmentation/generation
)


​Core Components:

    1.Spatial Attention Module 
     
    2.Residual Blocks (Visible as 62°.128 recurrent paths)

 
Ideal For

    1.Medical Image Segmentation
    
    2.Multi-channel Image Generation
    
    3.Super-Resolution Tasks


 Architectural Advantages
 
    ​1.Attention-Guided  focuses on critical regions
    
    2.​Vanishing Gradient Solution: Residual connections (e.g., 62°.128.128 loops)
